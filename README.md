<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-python-blue.svg" alt="made with python">


- This project was developed by my Team and I, as an entry to the Program Elective: Python A's Learning Activity. It was inspired from a variety of games released in the past, but mostly influenced by the discord bot **Epic RPG** which i have worked on as well.

- The Project aims for giving the user a fun time. It has elements of 'escapism' which impells the user to play the game repeatedly! 

- This game is a simple Text based Rpg format that was named as **SOLO LEVELING**
- It involves the *Main Character/Player* descending into a **monster infested World** to fight off monsters and gain experience and coins along the way!
- It has a shop, inventory, fight mechanics, location system, Save and Load game features etc
